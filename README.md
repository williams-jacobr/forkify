<b>forkify Project</b>

This is a simple to use recipe application that allows the use to look up their favourite recipes and upload their own, all in one place.

The application takes the user's input through a search bar and renders a list of results based on a preset list of search results available from the backend API. The user is able to input their own recipe via a modal which then saves the input in the same format as the backend API. It does not POST/PUT the recipe to the API but instead uses local storage.
